Credits: This is a common currency used in science fiction stories and games, and it's easy for players to understand and remember.
Crystalline Shards: This could be a more exotic and mysterious name for the currency, perhaps suggesting that it's made from rare or valuable materials found in space.
Wormhole Tokens: This could be a unique and interesting name for the currency, perhaps implying that it's used to pay for transit through wormholes or other exotic space-time phenomena.

Here are 10 types of upgrades that players might be able to purchase in a space-themed clicker game:

Faster engines: This upgrade would allow players to travel to different planets and galaxies more quickly, potentially increasing the speed at which they can explore and earn rewards.

Larger cargo bays: This upgrade would give players more space to store resources and equipment, potentially allowing them to take on more complex missions and explore more distant locations.

Enhanced weapons and armor: This upgrade would give players better defenses and offensive capabilities, potentially allowing them to take on more dangerous challenges and protect their spacecraft from threats.

Improved life support systems: This upgrade would allow players to support more crew members on their spacecraft, potentially increasing the size of their crew and the number of tasks they can accomplish.

Advanced research facilities: This upgrade would give players access to more advanced technologies and equipment, potentially allowing them to unlock new abilities and capabilities.

Enhanced navigation systems: This upgrade would improve the accuracy and reliability of the spacecraft's navigation systems, potentially allowing players to navigate more complex routes and explore more distant locations.

More efficient power systems: This upgrade would allow players to operate their spacecraft more efficiently, potentially reducing the cost of maintaining and upgrading the ship.

Improved communication systems: This upgrade would allow players to communicate more effectively with other spacecraft and space stations, potentially improving their ability to coordinate with allies and complete missions.

Enhanced shield systems: This upgrade would improve the spacecraft's defenses against attacks, potentially allowing players to survive more dangerous encounters.

Improved repair systems: This upgrade would allow players to repair their spacecraft more quickly and efficiently, potentially reducing the cost and time required to maintain the ship.

Here are a few ideas for upgrades that could allow the player to get credits faster in a game like Cosmic Capital:

Credit multiplier: This upgrade could increase the player's credit earnings by a certain percentage, making each credit worth more.

Credit production boost: This upgrade could increase the rate at which credits are produced, allowing the player to earn credits faster over time.

Credit storage capacity: This upgrade could allow the player to store more credits at once, allowing them to save up for larger purchases or investments.

Credit income boost: This upgrade could increase the player's overall credit income, perhaps by adding additional sources of income or by increasing the value of existing sources.

Credit-earning events: These upgrades could trigger special events that allow the player to earn a large number of credits in a short amount of time.

Credit exchange rate: This upgrade could allow the player to exchange credits for other resources or currencies at a favorable rate, potentially allowing them to earn more credits through trade. dynamic trading market

Credit-earning achievements: These upgrades could unlock special achievements that reward the player with credits for reaching certain milestones or completing certain tasks.
